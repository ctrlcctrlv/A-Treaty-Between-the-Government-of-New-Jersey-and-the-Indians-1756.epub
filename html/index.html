  <p class="dropcap">The Reaſon of our meeting you at this Time, is, that we might have an opportunity of talking freely with each other as <em class="calibre17">Brethren</em> ought to do.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">We grieve for the Sufferings of our <em class="calibre17">Brethren</em> in <em class="calibre17">Pennsylvania</em>, who have ſuſſered much by <em class="calibre17">Indians</em> miſled by bad and wicked Peoples Advice, but we hope an end will be ſoon put to their Murdering your <em class="calibre17">Friends</em> and ours, and beleive [sic] the <em class="calibre17">Indians</em> will by the trouble they will bring themſelves into by hearkening to this wicked Advice, be made to repent of their bad Actions.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">We hope none of our <em class="calibre17">Friends</em> and <em class="calibre17">Brethren</em> of this <span class="c">C</span>olony are joined with the Wicked <em class="calibre17">Indians</em> who have been deſtroying the People of <em class="calibre17">Pennsylvania</em>.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">As we have heard ſome of the Enemy <em class="calibre17">Indians</em> have been in the upper Parts of this Province, and Murdered one Man, and wounded another, this and the Murders on the other ſide of the River, has made our People who live in the upper Parts of this Colony ſo Angry, that it is become dangerous to any <em class="calibre17">Indians</em> to go there, as they will not in the hurry know Friends from Enemies. Therefore we would have you ſeriouſly conſider with yourſelves, that it will be neceſſary for you to contrive ſome Bounds for your own Security, where you may be ſafe, and our People eaſy with it.

<p class="calibre12"><em class="calibre17">Friday</em> Morning, <em class="calibre17">January</em> the 9th 1756.</p>

  <p class="calibre12">The Commiſſioners met.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">The <em class="calibre17">Indians</em> came into Council, and having appointed <em class="calibre17">Ohiockechoque</em>, to ſpeak for them; he delivered in their Names the following Anſwer.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">Dear <em class="calibre17">Brethren</em>,</p>

  <p class="pcalibre dropcap"><span class="smallcaps">Some</span> of our old Men can remember when the <em class="calibre17"><span class="c">E</span>ngliſh</em> were weak and few, and the <em class="calibre17">Indians</em> ſtrong and many. We then nurſed them up in our Boſoms and treated them as Friends. We are glad our Friendſhip hath continned [sic] ſo long, and hope it will always endure. Since our Fathers have ſold ſo large a Part of their Lands to the <em class="calibre17"><span class="c">E</span>ngliſh</em>, we find it much more difficult to maintain ourſelves and Families by Hunting, which is at leaſt one half our Support. But a worſe evil than that has come to us, which is the Uſe of ſtrong Liquor, to which the <em class="calibre17">Indians</em> are too much addicted, and by which they are made Weak, Idle, and Quarrelſome, and for ſtrong Drink often ſell thoſe Skins, and other Things, which would provide themſelves and Families with Cloaths and Bread, and for this ſome of the <em class="calibre17"><span class="c">E</span>ngliſh</em> are too much to blame.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">We beg you will take care to put a Stop to this wicked practiſe,<a id="calibre_link-11" class="calibre8"></a> which tho’ it may offend ſome of our fooliſh People at firſt, yet it will at laſt be beſt liked, and be more for the Health of Soul and Body.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">The bringing in the bleſſed Goſpel, we eſteem the greateſt advantage we have received by the <em class="calibre17"><span class="c">E</span>ngliſh</em> coming among us, and we truſt it hath been a means in the Hand of God to reform the Minds and Manners of a Number of us, and we prefer the <span class="c">E</span>njoyment of it and living with our <em class="calibre17">Brethren</em> the <em class="calibre17"><span class="c">E</span>ngliſh</em> even to Life itſelf. It gives us a real concern, that any of our Acquaintance are joined with the <em class="calibre17">French</em> and their <em class="calibre17">Indians</em>. The Reaſon of their going to them, we beleive [sic] was, that they were ſeduced by Lies and Falſity’s, becauſe the ſame Methods were uſed with us, but without effect. As Times of great Diſtreſs are come on us, as well as you, we are willing to agree as <em class="calibre17">Brethren</em>, upon any Methods for our mutual Peace and Security.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">We propoſe the following, which we hope may be effectual.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">We who live on this ſide <em class="calibre17">Rariton</em> River, will not on any occaſion, go to the Northward of <em class="calibre17">Rariton</em> River at <em class="calibre17">Brunſwick</em>, and of the great Poſt Road that leads from <em class="calibre17">Trenton</em> to <em class="calibre17">Brunſwick</em>, except in thoſe Town ſpots, but confine ourſelves between the ſaid Poſt Road and <em class="calibre17">Delaware</em> River, to the Sea Shores of this Province, while the War continues, in which Bounds we hope we ſhall always have the free Liberty of Hunting, and beg that good care may be taken, that no Traps ſhall be ſett there, which is of late very frequent and is very dangerous both to you and us.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">If any of our Young Men go to War with you, we hope you will put them upon the ſame footing with the <em class="calibre17"><span class="c">E</span>ngliſh</em>, and that when our Married Men go to War, you will make ſome Proviſion for their Families.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">As ſeveral of us are obliged to leave our Habitations in this time of general Diſtreſs, we pray that ſome Releif [sic] may be provided for ſuch. As it is the Misfortune of ſome of us to be in Debt, and we, for the publick Peace, are willing to deprive ourſelves of ſeveral advantages we formerly enjoy’d, we pray that care may be taken that our Creditors may not be two preſſing, and we promiſe as ſoon as we can, we will honeſtly pay our juſt Debts. We pray that all abuſive Words and Actions, which deſtroy be puniſhed in both <em class="calibre17">Indians</em> and <em class="calibre17"><span class="c">E</span>ngliſh</em>. We think we have ſtill ſome Peices [sic] of Land, for which we have received no Conſideration, if it ſhould prove ſo, and we could get the Money for them, we hope we ſhould be able, with ſome Aſſiſtance from our <em class="calibre17">Brethren</em> the <em class="calibre17"><span class="c">E</span>ngliſh</em>,<a id="calibre_link-12" class="calibre8"></a> to purchaſe a Peice [sic] of Land ſufficient for us all to ſettle together, and have the Goſpel among us, which is our great deſire.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">And we <em class="calibre17">Pompton</em> <em class="calibre17">Indians</em>, and others, living beyond <em class="calibre17">Rariton</em>, will confine ourſelves within a Line to be drawn from that Part of the Sound between <em class="calibre17">Staten Iſland</em> and the Main, which is neareſt to <em class="calibre17">John Jolines</em>, to go the neareſt Courſe to the ſaid <em class="calibre17">John Jolines</em> Houſe, and ſtraight three Miles further into the Woods, and ſo by a Line to be drawn thro’ the Woods, at three Miles diſtance, back from the great Road that leads from <em class="calibre17">John Jolines</em> to <em class="calibre17"><span class="c">E</span>lizabeth-Town</em>, <em class="calibre17">Newark</em>, <em class="calibre17">Wezel</em>, and <em class="calibre17">John Jerolimans</em> Mill, near the Falls of <em class="calibre17">Paſſaic</em>, and from the ſaid Falls near <em class="calibre17">Jerolimans</em> Mill to the Fork, and then to <em class="calibre17">Pompton</em>, and then on the neareſt ſtraight Line thro’ <em class="calibre17">Bergen</em> County, to the <em class="calibre17">Jerſey</em> Line on the Shore of the North River, or <em class="calibre17">Hudſons</em> River, and ſo by the Waters to were [sic] it began on the Sound.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">We have to complain to our <em class="calibre17">Brethren</em>, that ill minded Perſons are apt to take Advantage of the <em class="calibre17">Indians</em> when they are Drunk, and buy their Lands for a trifle, and often from the <em class="calibre17">Indians</em> who does not own it. And we pray our <em class="calibre17">Brethren</em>, that for the future no Indian Deed or Leaſe may be allowed to be good, but what is made and Signed before the Governor, or two of his Council, who are to have a Certificate from ſix <em class="calibre17">Indians</em>, that the Indian who ſells the Land, is Owner of it, under the Hand of ſome Magiſtrate, who ſees the ſix <em class="calibre17">Indians</em> Sign it, and the Deed to have it wrote on the back, and ſigned by the Governor, or two of his Council, that they ſaw the Certificate of the ſix <em class="calibre17">Indians</em>, Signed by the Juſtice, and that the Indian who ſells the Land, underſtood the Deed, and had a reaſonable Price as common for it.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">As ſome bad People have got a long Leaſe from a Drunken Indian for the Indian Lands at <em class="calibre17">Wepink</em>, and for which they pay moſtly, or all in ſtrong Drink, we beg that they may be removed from that Land, and we hope care will be taken that no looſe People ſettle on our Lands, without buying them.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">We heartily promiſe our <em class="calibre17">Brethren</em>, that if any ſtrange <em class="calibre17">Indians</em> ſhall come among us, we will immediately give Notice thereof to the next Juſtice or Captain, that they may be ſatisfied for what end they come: And if any Indian ſhould attempt to come among us, to draw us back from our <em class="calibre17">Brethren</em> the <em class="calibre17"><span class="c">E</span>ngliſh</em>, we will immediately ſecure them, and deliver them to our <em class="calibre17">Brethren</em>.

  <a id="calibre_link-13" class="calibre8"></a>

  <p class="dropcap">And if any of our own People ſhould be unruly or abuſive, we will deliver them up to the <em class="calibre17"><span class="c">E</span>ngliſh</em> to be puniſhed.</p>

  <p class="pcalibre dropcap"><span class="smallcaps">We</span> acknowledge the Kindneſs your Forefathers have ſhewn to ours, and we ſhall always Act kindly to you, as we hope you will always deſerve it, as long as the Waters run down <em class="calibre17">Delaware</em>.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">We are glad to find you acknowledge that your Fathers have ſold the Land we now poſſeſs to our Anceſtors, and we hope you have received Advantages by the riſing of the Price of your Skins, and Furs, and buying what you wanted at a reaſonable Rate, equal to the Loſs you have ſuffered by the ſcarcity of Deer and other Game.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">We are pleaſed to hear that you are ſenſible of the <span class="c">E</span>vils that ariſe by the too great habit of drinking ſpirituous Liquors among the <em class="calibre17">Indians</em>, and we ſhall lay that Matter before the Legiſlature of this Province, and ſhall endeavour to get a Proviſion made againſt that <span class="c">E</span>vil.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">It is agreeable to us, to hear that you ſo much Value the Bleſſed Goſpel, and that it has amended the Lives of ſo many of you, and the<a id="calibre_link-14" class="calibre8"></a> more you practice the Precepts of it, the better it will be for you.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">We are glad that the Lies and Falſities of your and our <span class="c">E</span>nemies, have not been able to draw you off from us, your <em class="calibre17">Brethren</em>, for your true Intereſt is faſt bound to ours.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">As to the Bounds you have propoſed for yourſelves, we agree with you as to them, and ſhall take care that you ſhall be ſecure in them.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">We hope none of our <em class="calibre17">Brethren</em> will diſtreſs you, unreaſonably, on Account of any Debts you owe them. And we recommend it to you to be Frugal and Induſtrious till you can pay them.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">We will lay it before the Legiſlature, to provide againſt your being deceived or defrauded in any Bargains, Grants or Leaſes of Land, that you may make hereafter.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">As to your Lands at <em class="calibre17">Wepink</em>, we ſhall make a Report about it, and you may depend upon ample Juſtice being done to you.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">We receive kindly the hearty Declarations you make to us, that you will give immediate Notice to the Officers of Government, when any ſtrange <em class="calibre17">Indians</em> come among you, and that you will ſecure ſuch as are your and our <span class="c">E</span>nemies.

<div class="calibre9" id="calibre_link-5">
<p class="dropcap">Then the <em class="calibre17">Indians</em> by <em class="calibre17">Ohiackchoque</em> return'd the following Anſwer, to what the <span class="c">C</span>ommiſſioners delivered to them this Morning.</p>

  <p class="dropcap"><em class="calibre17">Dear Brethren</em>,</p>

  <p class="pcalibre dropcap"><span class="smallcaps">We</span> have conſidered what you ſaid to us reſpecting the <em class="calibre17">Indians</em> who were bro't from the back Parts of the Province. We have ſtrictly examined them, and according to the beſt Judgment we are able to frame, we verily believe they had no bad deſigns againſt the <em class="calibre17"><span class="c">E</span>ngliſh</em>; but conſidering the deceitfulneſs of Man's Heart, we dare not engage for any but ourſelves, we would be Willing to take them to our Town at <em class="calibre17"><span class="c">C</span>ranberry</em>, and do our utmoſt to Watch over them, but the Fears and Jealouſies of our <em class="calibre17"><span class="c">E</span>ngliſh</em> Neighbours, are ſo great, that (as we are informed) it would not be for their or our ſafety to have them among us, and therefore do not chooſe to have any <span class="c">C</span>onnections with them, at leaſt for the preſent.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">The <span class="c">C</span>ommiſſioners afterwards enquired of the <em class="calibre17">Indians</em>, if they had the ſame Objections to the taking them to any of their other Towns, and informed them, that the <span class="c">C</span>ommiſſioners would make allowance of ſome Indian <span class="c">C</span>orn towards their ſupport this Winter, as they were removed from their own Habitations. Upon which <em class="calibre17">Quiſh</em> and the <span class="c">C</span>hiefs of the Indian Town in the Branches of <em class="calibre17"><span class="c">C</span>roſwicks</em>, agreed, as nothing appeared againſt theſe <em class="calibre17">Indians</em>, but that they were brought from their Habitation for their own Security, and the Peace of the upper Inhabitants, and that they could not return there again as being out of the Bounds the <em class="calibre17">Indians</em> had preſcribed to themſelves, that they would take them home, uſe them as <em class="calibre17">Brethren</em>, and have a careful <span class="c">E</span>ye over them.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">And the Indian Priſoners promiſſed to keep with the <em class="calibre17"><span class="c">C</span>roſwick</em> <em class="calibre17">Indians</em>, and to be have orderly.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">And they were delivered to them, whoſe Names were <em class="calibre17">Abraham Lewis,</em> <em class="calibre17">John Price,</em> <em class="calibre17">John Phillip,</em> and Twelve Women and <span class="c">C</span>hildren.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">And the <span class="c">C</span>ommiſſioners informed them, that they would Order ſome <span class="c">C</span>orn for the relief of thoſe who have ſuffered by their Love to us, and by being drove from their Habitations.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">And the Treaty broke up, and the <em class="calibre17">Indians</em> next Day went in an orderly Manner to their Towns.</p>

<div class="calibre9" id="calibre_link-3">
<p class="calibre12"><em class="noswash">What follows is added by Order of the <span class="c">C</span>ommiſſioners.</em></p>

  <p class="pcalibre dropcap"><span class="smallcaps">It</span> appeared to the <span class="c">C</span>ommiſſioners in the <span class="c">C</span>ourſe of this Treaty, that the <em class="calibre17">Indians</em> of <em class="calibre17">Suſquehannah</em>, have for three or four Years paſt, uſed many <span class="c">E</span>ndeavours to carry of [sic] to <em class="calibre17">Suſquehannah</em> all the <em class="calibre17">Indians</em> from this<a id="calibre_link-16" class="calibre8"></a> this Province, and have brought Belts of Wampom, in the Name of the <em class="calibre17">Mohocks</em>, to Order them to remove, tho’ the <em class="calibre17">Indians</em> never believed them to have been ſent by the <em class="calibre17">Mohowks</em>, and have refuſed to leave us.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">The Commiſſioners are convinced of the Sincerity of the <em class="calibre17">Indians</em> of this Province, and recommend it to the Inhabitants to uſe them kindly, to be careful not to ſupply them with ſtrong Drink, whereby many diſorders may be prevented.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">They alſo requeſt the Inhabitants not to uſe aggravating Language to the <em class="calibre17">Indians</em>, whereby rude and threatning Expreſſions may be drawn from them in their Drink, and thoſe improved into Tales to alarm weak People and raiſe ill Blood between the Inhabitants of the Colony and the <em class="calibre17">Indians</em>, which ought to be ſuppreſſed by all Means.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">They recommend it to the Inhabitants to conſider whether any Thing but their Love and Friendſhip to us, could have prevented their being new among our Enemies, and for this token of their Affection for us, they are intitled to our Friendſhip.</p>

  <p class="dropcap">As the ſpreading of reports, without a good Foundation, can only ſerve to give the Inhabitants uneaſineſs, they requeſt them carefully to ſuppreſs all Idle Stories, as they will tend to deſtroy their own Quiet and Repoſe.</p>
